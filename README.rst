The Open Space Singapore Community
==================================

The Open Space Singapore Community is a technical body of young professionals and students with a passion for the research and development of space science and engineering.

About the Community
-------------------

Our mission is to synergise the local aerospace community, create an avenue to channel our professional service back to the community, and give our younger talents a runway for learning and career development. We envision a cohesive aerospace community where we celebrate open discourse and promote mindshare for the greater good and for the development of our community members.

We work towards our goals first and foremost by making sure we love our tradecraft and have fun doing it! We also organise monthly rolling workshops, forums, and other activities where we discuss about developments in both space science and technology.

Our community is a community of professionals, rather than a professional community, and therefore all of our activities are informal, self-funded and volunteer-driven. If you would love to make a difference to the community, `join our community <https://forms.office.com/r/jYxk1QAHPH>`_ and be a contributor!

Please do check out our main website for more information.

In a nutshell, the idea of this community web page is to democratise the publishing of web content by everyone in the community. To do so, make sure you have **Python 3** with **Sphinx** and the **Sphinx-Panels** extension installed (using conda or pip). For full details, follow this `contributing guide <https://openspacesg.com/contrib.html>`_.
