.. dropdown:: An Introduction: The Open Space Singapore Community Initiative
	
	This is the first sharing and introduction to the Open Space Singapore (OSSG) Community initiative. OSSG is a technical body of young professionals and students with a passion for the research and development of space science and engineering. Our missions are to, first, synergise the local aerospace community, second, create an avenue to channel our professional service back to the community, and third, to give our younger talents a runway for learning and career development. Our vision is a cohesive aerospace community where we celebrate open discourse and promote a free exchange of ideas and resources for the greater good and for the development of our community members.
