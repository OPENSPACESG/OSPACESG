.. dropdown:: An Introduction: The Open Space Singapore Community Initiative
	:animate: fade-in
	
	This is the first sharing and introduction to the Open Space Singapore (OSSG) Community initiative. In this presentation, Samuel and Sarthak share the framework behind how the community is being run, what the community mission and vision is, and what activities and plans of action are to be expected over time.

.. dropdown:: Targeting Low-Thrust Earth-Moon Transfer Trajectories with Ballistic Capture
	:animate: fade-in
	
	A FreeFlyer algorithm is developed to find low-thrust Earth-Moon transfers with ballistic capture. Trajectory simulation is initialised near the Earth-Moon L1 Lagrange point where weak stability boundary conditions dominate. Forward and backward ballistic propagation allows for the longevity of temporal lunar capture to be characterised, while seeking stable high Earth orbit. A differential corrector varies initial parameters to achieve target geocentric semi-major axis through lunar gravitational assists in order to save fuel. Trajectories resulting in lunar crashes or ejection via L2 are truncated. A sample concept-of-operations from Geosynchronous Orbit to Low Lunar Orbit is simulated using ALIENA's MUSIC thruster.
