Contributing to Open Space Singapore
====================================

The Open Space Singapore project is purely community-driven research interest group, and as such, this project is open-sourced and thus contributable in all ways imaginable. Here are several ways you can contribute!

* Write and share research in our monthly OSSG Workshops.
* Review the community research work as a community peer reviewer.
* Join the development team that runs our online community.
* Join the editorial team that runs our quarterly newsletters.

You can join the community simply by subscribing to our mailing list in the home page! However, before you do, the OSSG community urges you to peruse our :ref:`conduct-label`.
