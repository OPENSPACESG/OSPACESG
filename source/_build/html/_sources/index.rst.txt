Welcome to the Open Space Singapore Community!
==============================================

The Open Space Singapore Community is a technical body of young professionals and students with a passion for the research and development of space science and engineering. Our mission is to synergise the local aerospace community, create an avenue to channel our professional service back to the community, and give our younger talents a runway for learning and career development. Our vision is a cohesive aerospace community where we celebrate open discourse and promote a free exchange of ideas and resources for the greater good and for the development of our community members.

We work towards our goals first and foremost by making sure we love our tradecraft and have fun doing it! We also organise monthly rolling workshops, forums, and other activities where we discuss about developments in both space science and technology. Please do check out our community news section and repositories for more information.

Our community is a community of professionals, rather than a professional community, and therefore all of our activities are self-funded and volunteer-driven. If you would love to make a difference to the community and be a part of our contributing team, you may read more about our community members in the community section, and a guide for contributing in the contributions section.

Finally, if you would like to join and contribute to the Open Space Singapore Community, please do familiarise yourself with our community code of conducts based on contributing guidelines below:
