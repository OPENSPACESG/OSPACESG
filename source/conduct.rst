Community Code of Conduct
=========================

Everyone, from students to young academics and engineers, are extremely welcome to participate and contribute! Of course, as with any well-meaning, good-spirited, and light-hearted community, a properly established code of conduct would be helpful to guide the community in its ethical and professional conduct.

It is therefore agreed upon by members of the Open Space Singapore (OSSG) Community, that the following code of conduct, also open-sourced and written by said members of the community, will be adhered to as ethically and as professionally as possible, in all manner of participation and contribution. It is also agreed upon that the following codes of conduct are general guidelines for the community, and not to be interpreted or represented as a formal article of the law, a legal statute, or a part of the constitution of Singapore.

Code of Conduct for All Participants
------------------------------------

The OSSG Community is committed to creating and maintaining an environment in which each member is treated with kindness, respect, inclusion and dignity, and is free from bullying, harassment and/or discrimination.

Discrimination, understood as a form of unequal treatment, intentional or unintentional, on the grounds of age, religion, sexual orientation, family or marital status, mental / physical / developmental ability, race, or citizenship, will not be tolerated in the community. Discrimination amounts to a serious offence if committed in Singapore, as per Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.

Harassment, understood as unwanted physical or verbal behaviour that is offensive or humiliating, will not be tolerated, regardless of whether intentional or unintentional; in-person or over the internet. Harassment amounts to a serious offence; individuals under Singapore Law are protected by the Protection from Harassments Act (POHA).

Falsification of information for the purposes of manipulation, misinformation, or deception of the community will not be tolerated. Proliferating false information that damages the community or public interest through the internet, especially through the OSSG community to the general public, is a chargeable offence under the Protection from Online Falsehoods Act (POFMA).

Code of Conduct for Speakers
----------------------------

First, speakers are strongly encouraged to submit abstracts about their current research projects through the sign-up form, and share development updates on their exciting space projects only where disclosable. For research-focused items, speakers should ensure that the research holds technically accurate content and that the delivery is clear, comprehensible and concise. 

Second, speakers must ensure that the work is free of plagiarism. Speakers must not pass off the work or ideas of other speakers as their own. If presenting the ideas of others, it should be presented as a literature review or structured in a narrative that leads to the speaker's original objective of the topic being discussed. Plagiarism is an unacceptable behaviour in any research community, and could lead to severe legal and ethical consequences. Speakers must also not give false credit or mis-attributions to another contributor, with the intent of deliberate dishonesty or deceit.

Third, it is the responsibility of the speaker to ensure that any sharing of research material online with the OSSG community does not infringe on any existing copyrights or intellectual property agreements. If the speaker has work published in a non-open-access journal, or if the funding source or organization supporting the speaker's research work has deemed the research to be highly sensitive and non-disclosable, then it is on the onus of the speaker to ensure that copyright infringements are not committed.

Finally, speakers, preseters and authors are all encouraged to openly welcome all honest feedback from the reviewing panel, and to maintain mutual respect and decency, for all intents and purposes, while discussing with their reviewers on how their research item can be improved.

.. _conduct-reviewers-label:

Code of Conduct for Reviewers
-----------------------------

First, reviewers are advised to give open, honest, and non-biased constructive feedback to speakers, presenters and authors. Should a reviewer feel unqualified in reviewing a particular domain, he/she should voice out for an alternative reviewer to take his/her place for the betterment of the review process.

Second, given the small size of our space community, reviewers should be mindful of not allowing their connections with the author, whether personal or professional, to bias their judgements of the author's presentation. 

Third, reviewers are expected to treat manuscripts or presentation files with strict confidentiality (within the reviewing panel and administrators) before the commencement of the OSSG workshops and seminars; all the more so, if the author intends to eventually publish their works in a closed academic journal.

.. _conduct-editors-label:

Code of Conduct for Editors
---------------------------

The editorial team's key responsibility is the dissemination of our quarterly newsletters, and to ensure that the community can keep themselves updated with the research and development happenings in the Open Space Singapore Community. As such, editors are also entrusted with collaboration rights on the community's GitHub page. This means that editors, like admins, are trusted to change web-content wherever and whenever, for the curation of better content for the community.

In line with the professional expectations, editors must ensure that information is formatted in a comprehensible manner for the community on the web portal; curated and chosen without any discrimination or biased selectivity of information; and disseminated to all in the mailing list in a timely manner. Editors who wish to edit the site contents should follow standard Git workflow and best practices where needed.

.. _conduct-admin-label:

Code of Conduct for Administrators
----------------------------------

The OSSG Administrators are the core organisers of the community. As such, administrators possess the privilege of accessing the community materials, the community Outlook and OneDrive, as well as possessing collaborator rights on the community's GitHub page (as with the editorial team). Administrators hold a relatively large responsibility in the community, and are expected to represent the community well and pursue project or activities that are meaningful to the development of the community.

In line with ethical conduct, administrators should first and foremost facilitate the community guidelines, including but not limited to the Community Code of Conduct, without bias to other members and without abuse of privilege. Second, the administrators must moderate discourse in the community using fair judgement and treatment in every situation. Third, the administrators should communicate to our community members in a professional and approachable manner, and refrain from allowing personal biases to influence community relationships. Fourth, the administrators should never create unprofessional community material that reflects poorly on themselves or the community (i.e. illegal material, racially or religiously harmful content, 

In line with the expectations of the community's professional service, the administrators should also organise the activities with the inclusion of everyone in the community in mind. Administrators should also deliver the community material or announcements of new activities to members through the community email in a timely and responsible manner. Administrators should also ensure that community material on the OPENSSG web portal remains accurate, up-to-date, and relevant material.
