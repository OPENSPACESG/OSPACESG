About Our Community
===================

Our community is a community of professionals, rather than a professional community, and therefore all of our activities are informal, self-funded and volunteer-driven. The diversity and expertise of our people are the pillars for this community. With their spirit of innovation and collaboration, the community can foster much stronger bonds, exchange big ideas freely, and promote a more vibrant space community in Singapore. This page is a dedicated directory of our community, links to join the community, and our contacts.
