Welcome to the Open Space Singapore Community!
==============================================

The Open Space Singapore Community is a technical body of young professionals, hobbyists and students with a passion for the research and development of space science and engineering.

Our mission is to synergise the local aerospace community, create an avenue to channel our professional service back to the community, and give our younger talents a runway for learning and career development. We envision a cohesive aerospace community where we celebrate open discourse and promote mindshare for the greater good and for the development of our community members.

We work towards our mission first and foremost by making sure we love our tradecraft, and have fun doing it! We organise monthly rolling workshops, forums, and other activities where we discuss about developments in both space science and technology. Do checkout our site links for more information!
