Community Code of Conduct
=========================

Welcome to the Open Space Singapore Community!

Everyone - students, young engineers, scientists, business professionals, policy makers, and even astronauts, are extremely welcome to participate and contribute! Of course, as with any well-meaning, good-spirited, and light-hearted community, a properly established code of conduct would be helpful to guide the community in its ethical and professional conduct.

We hope that your stay in the community will be meaningful, while we abide by the following codes of conduct as a general guideline for behaviours in the community.

Code of Conduct for All Participants
------------------------------------

The OSSG Community is committed to creating and maintaining an environment in which each member is treated with kindness, respect, inclusion and dignity, and is free from bullying, harassment and/or discrimination.

Discrimination, understood as a form of unequal treatment, intentional or unintentional, on the grounds of age, religion, sexual orientation, family or marital status, mental / physical / developmental ability, race, or citizenship, will not be tolerated in the community. Discrimination amounts to a serious offence if committed in Singapore, as per Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.

Harassment, understood as unwanted physical or verbal behaviour that is offensive or humiliating, will not be tolerated, regardless of whether intentional or unintentional; in-person or over the internet. Harassment amounts to a serious offence; individuals under Singapore Law are protected by the Protection from Harassments Act (POHA).

Falsification of information for the purposes of manipulation, misinformation, or deception of the community will not be tolerated. Proliferating false information that damages the community or public interest through the internet, especially through the OSSG community to the general public, is a chargeable offence under the Protection from Online Falsehoods Act (POFMA).

Code of Conduct for Speakers
----------------------------

As a speaker, we thank you for submitting your talks to the community! While the community grows and learns from your knowledge, the administrators must remind speakers that only content which does not infringe on copyrights or existing non-disclosure agreements should be shared. If the funding source for the speaker's research or project has deemed the speaker's work to be highly sensitive and non-disclosable, the speaker should refrain from sharing this content with the community.

In addition, speakers should ensure that the work is free of plagiarism. Speakers should not pass off the work or ideas of others as their own. However, it is perfectly fine to present the published research of others, as long as it is clearly delivered in the form of a literature review, without copyright infringements and with credits to the original authors given.

Finally, speakers are encouraged to openly and respectfully welcome honest feedback from the community!

Code of Conduct for Administrators
----------------------------------

The Open Space Singapore Administrators are the core organisers of the community. Administrators hold a large responsibility in the community, and are expected to represent the community well and pursue projects or activities that are meaningful to the development of the community.

Administrators hold the rights to accessing the community web materials, managing the community Discord server, maintaining the community Outlook and OneDrive, as well as possessing collaborator rights on the community's GitHub page to curate the web content for the public and for the community. 

In line with ethical conduct, administrators should first and foremost facilitate the community guidelines, including but not limited to the Community Code of Conduct, without bias to other members and without abuse of privilege. Second, the administrators must moderate discourse in the community using fair judgement and treatment in every situation. Third, the administrators should communicate to our community members in a professional and approachable manner, and refrain from allowing personal biases to influence community relationships. Fourth, the administrators should never create unprofessional community material that reflects poorly on themselves or the community (i.e. illegal material, racially or religiously harmful content).
