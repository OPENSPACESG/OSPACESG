Community Events
================

Our next publicly open rolling workshop is launching soon! Our rolling workshops are basically casual and relaxed meet-ups, where there is no fixed scope or theme as to what you can present. We mostly talk about our latest research and development of our space missions or satellites, or hold discussions on new ideas or community projects.

Our Next Open Space Rolling Workshop (30-Jul-2021, 20:00 SGT)
